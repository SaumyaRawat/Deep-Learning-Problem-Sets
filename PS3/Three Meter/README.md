This is the magnetic field data collected from the surface of a spinning ball of molten sodium designed to simulate the inner core of the earth in IREAP (next to AV Williams); it's called the Three Meter Experiment. The optimal autoencoding width of a chaotic physical system like this can be thought to represent the correct number of variables to model the system in, and the fact that this can be found quantitatively with no apriori knowledge is very profound. No dataprocessing code is provided because this is the raw output of their data acquisition system. 

This data must be fit with a simple feed forward autoencoder (no VAEs, etc.). If you want to do something that doesn't seem basic, talk to Justin before doing it but expect a no. This is not the case for the extra credit based around this.

Anyone who harasses the professor in charge of the three meter experiment will have their grade severely penalized.
